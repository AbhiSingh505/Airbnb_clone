Explanation video: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ccvmp7BY9Tykb4r2xhpkkbErMRHypsV_/view?usp=sharing`

## What’s new
- Custom animated bottom tab bar with matched-geometry selection
- Collapsible, blurred top bar in Explore with scroll-aware behavior
- Reusable shimmer skeletons for loading states across lists and images
- Matched-geometry transition from search results to detail view
- Centralized theme extension and subtle haptics utilities

## Screens
- Explore: Search entry, filters, sections, and dynamic top bar
- Wishlist, Trips, Messages, Profile

## Run
1. Open `syGroupTask.xcodeproj` in Xcode 15+
2. Build & run on iOS 17+ simulator or device

## Notes
- Assets are included in `Assets.xcassets`
- Core colors and haptics live in `syGroupTask/core`

## Roadmap ideas
- Map-based explore
- Parallax image headers in detail
- Offline caching for images and data
